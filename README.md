# ED-ConvLSTM
This repository contains all the codes for the training of **ED-ConvLSTM** and the baseline **U-Net**.

## File list:
- Train: the training script for ED-ConvLSTM
- Model_simple: the model ED-ConvLSTM
- MyDataset: the dataset reader for ED-ConvLSTM
- Unet_train: the training script for U-Net
- Unet_model: the model U-Net
- Unet_dataset: the dataset reader for U-Net
- all the plot_xxx.ipynb: plotting jupyternotebooks
- model weights for pressure and saturation are also included (.pth file)

*Note:* the dataset is too large (up to 60GB) to upload.
